# HammerWarsDiscordBot
-----
The *HammerWarsDiscordBot* is a Discord bot written in Python that has commands to send announcements and other stuff.

The bot will be hosted on [railway.app](https://railway.app) soon! Until then, it's being hosted on `Oohwo#1324`'s laptop.

This bot will probably be shutdown once the HammerWars event is over ðŸ˜”

## Purpose
We're currently running our second iteration of HammerWars alongside the Purdue Competitive Programming Union with AWS and Deloitte as sponsors :D [Check out what happened last year!](https://events.purduehackers.com/-hammerwars-)

While creating the HammerWars Discord category, I decided to create this bot to simply send announcements. 

Why? 1. Embeds just look cooler and 2. Haha I can be somewhat anonymous

There's not much else to the bot except for that BUT I guess there's a `/morbius` command that I forgot to delete from another Discord bot I made for fun...

## Note
There's probably better ways to implement some of the commands :( Apologies if you see some bad code lol
